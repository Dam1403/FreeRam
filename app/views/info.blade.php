    "Random-access memory (RAM /r√¶m/) is a form of computer data storage. A random-access
    memory device allows data items to be accessed (read or written) in almost the same
    amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory. In
    contrast, with other direct-access data storage media such as hard disks, CD-RWs,
    DVD-RWs and the older drum memory, the time required to read and write data items
    varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium,
    due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement." -Wikipedia
